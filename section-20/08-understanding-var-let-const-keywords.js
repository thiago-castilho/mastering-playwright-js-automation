// Difference between var, let and const
// As of ES6 they introdced two new keywords: let and const.
// We cannot redeclare variable with let keyword but possible with var.
// But another situation is: We can re-assign with var and let keyword.
// const cannot be re-initialized


// var - global/function level
// let - global/block level {}
// const - 

//const
